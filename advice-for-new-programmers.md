College is important, and a degree in computer science or computer engineering will be highly valuable. What sets programmers apart, however, is whether you write code that people use. Colleges never tell you that you don't actually do that in your coursework. The code you write is for a grade. In general, colleges rely on internships for actual programming, and you'll find that most professors have never written professional code.

Meaning, to become a programmer, in addition to considering a good college, you'll have to teach yourself to code. Start with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which is oriented more toward people changing careers than those headed to college, but all the better to learn early that neither age nor education make you a programmer. (Write code that people use.)

With the goal to write code that people use, the trick is to write code that _you_ use. You have a computerâ€”program it to solve a problem.

It takes years to become a proficient programmer, even after graduating college. The advice here is to accelerate that path for you, to encourage you to learn code in addition to college. Above all, you need practice. Unless you are reading this on a printout, you have in front of you a computer [waiting for you](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/say-hello-to-html-elements) to say "Hello, world!"
