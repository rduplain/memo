## 1. System of Record

| _State of the system:_
| _code, tests, docs, data, users;_
| _neither you nor specs._


## 2. Continuous Integration, Delivery

| _Through CI/CD,_
| _keep software in working state,_
| _not "done" until shipped._


## 3. Clean Code Discipline

| _Explore prototypes_
| _then invest in quality_
| _early in project._


## 4. How-To Solve It

| _Understand problem,_
| _devise plan, carry it out,_
| _look back and repeat._


## 5. Software as Craft

| _Clear goals, feedback loop,_
| _disciplined craft practitioners_
| _reach a state of flow._


## 6. An Open Letter

| _What's technical debt?_
| _The result of non-planning._
| _It does not exist._


## 7. Communication as Cost

| _Use cases, specs, docs,_
| _have noise and non-zero cost,_
| _they're not all value._


## 8. North Star Navigation

| _Key to reducing_
| _cost of communication:_
| _goals with permanence._


## 9. Consensus Across Boundaries

| _Design by contract_
| _down to surface area_
| _that's easy to test._


## 10. Deadline as Cost

| _A "five minute task"_
| _in the backlog for three months_
| _has taken three months._


## 11. Now or Not-Now

| _With north star in mind_
| _step in the right direction_
| _strictly: now, not now._


## 12. Placement of Backlog

| _Backlog not features_
| _but requests before triage;_
| _work in progress: one._


## 13. Creativity through Ambiguity

| _You will never know_
| _at once, everything you know_
| _through iteration._


## 14. Exposition as Means

| _Artifacts must have_
| _clarity, resulting from_
| _the writing process._


## 15. Clarity through Constraints

| _You can deliver_
| _a keynote presentation_
| _in a lightning talk._


## 16. Craft as Prerequisite

| _Ambiguity,_
| _now, not now, total nonsense;_
| _form follows finance._


## 17. Engineering is Trade-Offs

| _Discipline not lost,_
| _find proxy variables,_
| _enable trade-offs._
