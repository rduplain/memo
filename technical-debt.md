# Productive "Technical Debt"

Technical debt is meaningful when it characterizes the decision to apply
prototypical methods and shortcuts as a means of leverage toward a
business/organization benefit. If you're not making these decisions in a
deliberate way and you are acquiring "technical debt" anyway, then it's not
debt but sunk cost.

A sunk cost is compounded when repeated. Most often, when people say "technical
debt," they mean to stop doing _that_: stop repeating the process of sunk
cost. That--sunk cost upon sunk cost--is especially not technical debt.

If the team is not engaged in engineering approaches--clarifying, setting,
meeting objectives and managing trade-offs--then "technical debt" is undefined.
