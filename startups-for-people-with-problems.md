# Startups for People with Problems

_The Moment You Consider Raising Funds_

by **Ron DuPlain**


## Purpose

When you have a problem, a real problem affecting real people, and you cannot
shake off your ideas on how to solve it, you'll eventually come across the
notion that maybe you should start a new company. You'll certainly find guiding
resources if you identify as an entrepreneur. If, like me, you are more focused
on solving problems than creating companies, you'll perhaps wonder where to
begin.

This essay sits between "generate and validate good startup ideas" and "build
and run an effective company." Given an idea worth pursuing, this essay
provides an exposition for _the moment you consider raising funds_.

There are many expositions on startups. This one is mine. I am speaking from a
founder perspective.


## About Me

I am an engineer first and foremost. I have been involved in entrepreneurial
projects for my entire engineering career. Being a programmer and C-Suite
executive who has "done it before," I often get the open-ended request to "pick
your brain" about startups. Ask around, and you'll find that this isn't the
best way to ask for a meeting (with anyone). This essay can serve as an
accelerator from "pick your brain" to specific questions in context. Feel free
to ask questions.

## #1: Make sure it is a business.

I always start with a simple cocktail-napkin test:

* Imagine your product or service.
* Imagine your market. Who is your customer?
* Guess the size of the market. How many total customers might exist?
* Make up a price.
* **If you get 10% of the market at the price, do you have a business?**

Even if these are wild guesses, and even if 10% is unrealistic, if you can look
at these numbers on the back of your cocktail napkin and get excited, then you
are on to something. 10% of the market at your made-up price can either feel
like (a) a very big deal or (b) enough to keep expanding the business. Both are
valid at this point when the market is big or you believe that you can capture
a majority of a niche market, respectively.

Your work will soon be to validate these assertions, but if you cannot step
through this simple test with meaningful results, then you don't have a
potential product-market fit and _you do not have a business_. Keep iterating,
and make it a habit to apply this simple test as you explore business models.

You may have reasons to continue without a business model anyway. Setting the
cocktail-napkin test aside means that you cannot predict when you'll have any
revenue (and you are making it a point to have revenue eventually, right?). In
particular, if you are looking to make an exit through acquisition, note: (a)
prospective acquirers will want to see that the product adds value, (b) revenue
is a clear measure of that value, and (c) being in a cash-poor position weakens
negotiation ability, such that an acquirer can wait it out for a better price
while you run out of money.

People spend weeks, months, and even years on a business model which would fail
this simple cocktail-napkin test.

(Why 10%? It's a simple number to characterize your intended market. Note that
products intending to _cross the chasm_ to mainstream usage will take more than
10% adoption.)


## #2: Make sure it is a business that you want to run.

Very often, people are excited about ideas. What if we had this? What if we
could do that? The world would be a better place if your idea were reality,
after all, so you might think that there are people or companies who are just
waiting to hear it so that you can hand it off and they will run the business
for you. If you are serious about an idea and want to create a startup, make
sure that startup is a business that you actually want to run, because _you are
going to be the one running it_.

Keep exploring business models until you have a business that you want to run.

Find a cofounder as needed.

Even if you are wildly successful, [you can expect to be in the business for
seven-plus years][unicorn], and you might still run the business after the
company makes an "exit."

## #3: All about capital.

### #3.1: The path ahead.

The path of raising funds ("capital") is one of building wealth.

Identify a product/service of value, make a plan to deliver, make a projection
of the market and share of customers, and put these together to claim a
valuation.

For example, raise $1M by selling 20% (fully diluted) equity in a company that
has a (post-money) valuation of $5M.

What puts a company's total value at $5M? There are a few methods, but at this
point, it's mostly about being convinced that the revenue potential is there.
(See #1: _Make sure it is a business_.) A company's value can be a multiple of
its revenue, or not tied on revenue at all, based on how readily the company
could reinvest its profits, enter new markets, or be acquired. Acquisition
would mean selling majority or full ownership of the company to another company
(in exchange for cash, stock in the acquiring company, or both), or merging
with one.

The very first episode of _HBO's Silicon Valley_ has an incredible moment right
up front in which the founder is considering whether to sell the company or
take investment. The two investors know way more than the founder, and the
discussion is at once fast-paced/dizzying and profoundly insightful/accurate.

Short of getting an acquisition offer before you even start--as is fiction in
_Silicon Valley_--valuation at this stage is going to be more about projections
than fundamentals. You are starting entirely with intangible value, unless you
are licensing/transferring existing intellectual property.


### #3.2: Getting started without a valuation.

Your valuation is low or impossible to predict when are you getting
started. You will uncover many solutions to this very problem. [SAFE
notes][safe-notes] are one such solution, even with their [own
problems][safe-note-problems]. The idea is to defer a more firm valuation until
a later date. More broadly, a convertible note allows a founding team to
"borrow" money with intent to convert the debt into equity at a future round.

[safe-notes]: https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/
[safe-note-problems]: https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/08/why-safe-notes-are-not-safe-for-entrepreneurs/

You can raise funds with debt instead of selling shares of equity. This often
means a "note payable" at a maturity date, with some percentage of return. For
example, borrow $100k and repay $112k a year later, using 12% of simple
interest maturing annually. In general, investors will want to convert the note
into equity over time, reinvesting the return instead of remitting payment,
which ultimately arrives at note instruments for future equity,
i.e. convertible notes as mentioned above. Besides, a 12% rate of return is
better invested in lower risk ventures, and startups are best optimized toward
the highest valuation with the least amount of cash.

There are also financial instruments which provide a same-as-cash line of
credit from a conventional bank, but the psychology of startup finance is to
invest for the long term with high return resulting from high risk. In general,
your balance sheet takes on cash when you sell shares to an investor or
products and services to a customer.

(Note that when you do take on debt instruments, creditors will look to
founders to personally guarantee the funds, making you liable for the cash in
the event of default, i.e. when the new startup company misses a payment
due. Treat lines of credit and credit cards like your own cash.)


### #3.3: Dilution.

With every new investment, founders dilute. As do any other shareholders:
common stock holders (anyone receiving equity as part of compensation, founders
included) and previous investors. This means that if you are 100% owner, or if
you have a 50/50 split (etc) between founders, then your share in the total
ownership will decrease as you add each investor. All of this is tracked in a
document called the capitalization table ("cap table" for "who put in what"
starting with founder share).

Put another way, you own a smaller piece of a larger pie. That is the whole
point in raising capital instead of bootstrapping your business through
revenue. You need the capital to get the revenue, or else it is not advisable
to raise (as much) capital.

**Once you get past the complete overwhelm of all of this, continue reading
when you have the moment of:**

> **Ah, so that's the "capital" in capitalism!**
> **All these years, "capital" hiding in plain sight.**


### #3.4: Rounds of fundraising.

Funding happens in rounds, commonly: seed (sometimes called "angel"), A, B, C,
.... At every round of funding, there is a balancing act to raise the right
amount of capital. You want to balance valuation with runway. The CEO has a
responsibility to shareholders to maximize the value of existing shares. In a
few words, take a good deal (and make revenue a top priority). But with an
acceptable level of risk. If you do not raise enough money (the runway), then
the company could go out of business or be in a vulnerable position for future
investment, leading to a down round in which shares are purchased at a value
lower than the previous round--which is _not good_ (see #3.5 below).

The seed round is often called the angel round, because the amounts (10s or
100s of thousands) are more appropriate to individuals of high net worth
("angels") than to institutional firms ("VCs").

If you would like to raise money from friends and family, you can certainly do
so. Tell them that they will lose their money and see if they still want to do
it. Turns out, they will. Their goal is to support you, not a return on
investment. Note that the [SEC has an opinion about who can
invest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp).


### #3.5: Think about the down round.

Imagine how great it will be when you close on millions of dollars. No one can
question whether your ideas are valid. You can pay yourself a proper salary.
You can now hire for all of the things that you are now too busy to do as an
accomplished startup CEO. You've arrived.

No, you haven't. Raising money is not the end goal.

There's such a thing as too much money. Follow-on rounds are going to depend on
a business which increases in value. Generally, this means revenue. Not just
revenue, but [**multiples** of revenue growth][t2d3]. While getting _any_
investment is your immediate concern, think about the down-round scenario--the
case where shares are purchased at a value lower than the previous round--and
work to avoid it. Progressively show value through multiple rounds (potentially
multiple seed or convertible debt rounds) instead of taking a large sum of
money up front.

Alternatively, bootstrap a product/service by building it nights and weekends,
and skip the first seed round.

### #3.6: Institutional investors.

Back to institutional investors, they generally seek preferred stock. These come
with specific terms, but in short: they get paid before you do should the
company ever change hands or dissolve.

A few words about institutional investors, noting that I am speaking from the
founder's perspective and not the investor's:

* Investors are generally interested in financial projections which have
  oversized returns, meaning that the projection has exponential growth. This
  exponential growth, to me, defines a startup. Conversely, small businesses or
  long-running companies will focus on year-over-year growth, which is
  approximately linear or compounded growth rates. For a startup, imagine a
  slide deck with a hockey stick projecting valuation, typically based on
  revenue. Even if it is made up, many investors want to see that you will go
  after it regardless.
* Very often a startup has more than one investor in a round. The first
  investor to commit will shape the terms for other investors.
* Like any sales process, raising money often means talking to 10 prospective
  investors for every 1 investor.
* Several VCs will say, "Sounds great! Come back when you need [some number in
  the millions]."
* They may also say something which indicates to you, "Oh, and come to us
  before talking with other investors." Then, you really know that they are
  interested, because they think they have a headstart to you on knowing the
  value of your company.


### #3.7: Millionaire.

One final note on raising capital. In doing so, you are instantly a
millionaire. Of course, not really. You hold stock in a company for which there
is no stock market. But your relationship to money and to risk will be
tested. Especially when you are taking real dollars from people who know
precisely their relationship to money and to risk.


## #4: Keep the cap table clean.

For context, consider the "serial entrepreneur":

1. Sets out to offer a product or service.
2. Along the way, learns everything about running a business. The hard way.
3. What to do with these new skills? Well, let's start another one!

Alternatively, being the first-time entrepreneur or first-time _anything_ means
that there is no way that you have all of the skills.

You are going to want to get people involved. You are going to value their
input. You are going to want to compensate them for that. You are going to want
to give them equity instead of cash since (a) you do not have much cash but you
have a lot of equity and (b) you want them to have an incentive in your
success.

Be slow in giving out equity _at this point_. Building a successful business is
a long game. A contribution will feel like a lot today, but will likely be a
small blip in the long run.

It's not selfish to keep equity to yourself. It's what's best for the
company. You run a company now.

Keeping the cap table clean means that only founders and critical people have
equity before raising money, and when you raise money, you do so with the full
amount that you need to operate the company for 12-24 months (much like closing
on a mortgage).

Besides, people do not expect compensation when helping out. Not at first,
anyway.


## #5: Vest.

When you give people equity in the form of common stock, have it vest over time
instead of having them hold the equity immediately. This is true for everyone,
including cofounders, no matter how well you trust them.


## #6: Splitting equity.

How do you split equity among founders? **Engage in respectful discussion until
you have consensus.**

A good starting point is to consider all founders as equal contributors:

* 50/50
* 33.3/33.3/33.3 (Where does that 0.1% go?)
* 25/25/25/25
* ...

I prefer to wait until the team has consensus on how the business will provide
value before discussing how to split equity. It's reasonable to split equity
based on relative contribution to the startup, but:

* it is hard to measure relative contribution
* it is even harder to agree on relative contribution
* relative contribution changes over time

**Founders dilute equally, and it's important to identify the split up front,
plan for dilution, and stick to it.** It's possible to shift relative equity
later with option grants, but do not count on this.

In particular, it's useful to have non-equal splits to avoid requiring a
tie-breaker. In the case of two founders working to build a prototype:

* 51% -- Founder A
* 44% -- Founder B
* 5% -- Option Pool (to distribute to other contributors)

Founder A will have majority until the company adds investors, which will
dilute all of the above common stock shareholders. Once diluted, the company
will either need agreement of the founders or agreement between one founder and
the investors in order to have a majority decision. Alternatively, to have a
sole decision maker, you may want to project the fully diluted cap table after
seed investment to be:

* 51% -- Founder A
* 29% -- Founder B
* 15% -- Seed Investors
* 5% -- Option Pool (to distribute to other contributors)

Why would _Founder B_ do this, and who wants to be "_B_" anyway? Perhaps
_Founder A_ is the domain expert with business savvy who understands the
problem. Perhaps the company will be more productive--and therefore more
rapidly increase its valuation--if _Founder A_ can execute on a vision as the
sole decision-maker. The total value of each person's equity share is more
important than the percentage each founder has.

Speaking more broadly of collaboration, consensus and alignment are important
to just about any organization's culture. But they take time and there is a
trade-off between giving everybody equal input and empowering an architect to
carefully design the business and its vision, model, and product/service. At
the very least, regardless of whether you have a majority decision-maker, be
sure to provide every member of the team (including shareholders) an
opportunity to contribute to the direction of the business.

Regarding the diluted-with-investment 51%/29% split, it's a reasonable proposal
when you have one person who has a clear vision, has done startups before, and
is going to go full-time. The other person in this case could be someone who is
critical in co-developing the product/service, perhaps as a savvy
first-customer type who will provide product management part-time while
continuing to operate another business. This goes counter to popular advice
that "everyone gets equal equity" which assumes/encourages that all founders go
all in. There's no "one way" to split equity.

It's possible to achieve a certain decision-making pattern with non-voting
shares ([discussion][non-voting-common]) in order to separate economic rights
(financial value of equity) from voting rights.

[non-voting-common]: https://www.huntonak.com/images/content/3/4/v2/34138/nonvoting-common-stock.pdf

Discuss equity plans with the company's legal counsel, noting that the counsel
will be representing the interests of the new startup company and not of
individuals, though may bias to whomever the CEO is by extension of
representing the company's interests. You have legal counsel for your new
startup company, right?

To reiterate, founders dilute equally, and it's important to identify the split
up front, plan for dilution, and stick to it.

As for how to split the option pool, predict how many employees, contributors,
and advisers you would like to have and keep some additional options in
reserve. The 5% number in the examples above indicates a base amount to include
in the seed round for the option pool, before investment. Every round of new
investment in the future will present a chance to introduce new options.

There's no right answer on how to split equity. No matter how decisions are
made, consensus and buy-in are critical. Trust is paramount.


## #7: A perspective on medical startups.

Innovating in healthcare in the United States is _complicated_. A full,
separate discussion could unpack the various reasons _why_, but within the
scope of this discussion:

1. It's not enough to provide great user experience, your product needs to be
   clinically relevant.
2. The people who need your product the most are typically not the decision
   maker and therefore not your customer.

Accordingly, your product needs to be sensitive to the many layers of how
healthcare is delivered, and your business model needs to account for who is
making the decision to buy a new product. Often this decision is once or twice
removed by an enterprise health system or an insurance carrier (or "payer" in
the broader sense).

For medical startups focused on a health condition, either directly or
indirectly, I have found that it is very important to focus on a clinically
valid approach with a wellness/disease management context before being
concerned with commercialization. Get some preliminary data _at least_ if not a
full clinical trial. Make sure you build something from a clinical basis, not a
technology basis.

This makes fundraising particularly complicated in the early stage. That said,
health systems often invest in addition to being a customer. Selling to a
hospital takes 18 months +/-. Within a large enterprise, on a long-enough
timescale, sophisticated management will recognize that the organization
internally has too much hierarchy and is too risk-averse to innovate. They
_need_ to look externally to innovate.

But Silicon Valley, and I do mean the region not the _HBO_ show, brings
"disruption" without even a clue that _clinically valid_ is a thing. The
quality improvement loop--dissemination & implementation of the latest evidence
into the care setting--may be severely challenged in US healthcare, but it's
nonexistent to the "app developer." Accordingly, "app" has become a four-letter
word in healthcare.

If you have a medical startup and you are raising capital, know the word
"[theranos][theranos]" before anyone else mentions it.

## #8: Roller coasters.

A startup is an emotional roller coaster until you are convinced that the
company/product/service that you are building is valid. Who knows when that
will happen. So, take the validation that you can and find your support
network.

Once off the emotional roller coaster, you are on the stress roller
coaster. "What's the problem today?"


## #9: You will meet people with big egos.

... and they will be so charismatic they will naturally feign a sense of
humility.

There is an abundance of people who have made a career out of all things
business. You will think they have some credential that you do not. You will
eventually conclude that it is all hollow, so let's save you some time and just
assume that it probably is (because it probably is).

Cynical, yes. The slightly less cynical justification: in every profession, the
best and brightest in the field will tell you that anywhere from 10-30% of
people in the field actually know what they are doing. More broadly, this is
the 80/20 principle, which applies to just about anything. Business is no
exception.

Regarding investors, there's smart money and dumb. Investors get good at asking
questions and getting to crux of the problem. Sometimes that problem is
actually your problem.


## Closing

Above all, make it a point to know your business better than anyone. And do not
be afraid to ask questions or share your ideas.

There's always more to say. I'll stop here.
