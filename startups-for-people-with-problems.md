## Purpose

When you have a problem, a real problem affecting real people, and you cannot
shake off your ideas on how to solve it, you'll eventually come across the
notion that maybe you should start a new company. You'll certainly find
resources if you identify as an entrepreneur. If, like me, you are more focused
on solving problems than creating companies, you'll perhaps wonder where to
begin.

This essay sits between "generate and validate good startup ideas" and "build
and run an effective company." Given an idea worth pursuing, this essay
provides an exposition on how to _create a company worth investment the moment
you consider raising funds_.

There are many expositions on startups. This one is mine. I am speaking from a
founder perspective.


## About Me

I am an engineer first and foremost. I have been involved in entrepreneurial
projects for my entire engineering career. Being a CTO who has "done it
before", I often get questions about startups. This essay can serve as an
accelerator from "pick your brain" to specific questions in context.


## #1: All about raising capital.

The path of raising capital is to build wealth.

Identify a product/service of value, make a plan to deliver, make a projection
of the market and respective share, and put these together to claim a
valuation.

For example, raise $1M by selling 20% (fully diluted) equity in a company that
has a (post-money) valuation of $5M.

S01E01 of _HBO's Silicon Valley_ has an incredible moment right up front in
which the founder is considering selling the company vs taking investment. The
two investors know way more than the founder, and the discussion is at once
fast-paced/dizzying and profoundly insightful/accurate.

Short of getting an acquisition offer before you even start (as in _Silicon
Valley_), valuation at this stage is going to be more about projections than
fundamentals. You are starting entirely with intangible value, unless you are
licensing/transferring existing intellectual property.

Your valuation is low or impossible to predict when are you getting
started. You will uncover many solutions to this very problem. [SAFE
notes](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/) are popular, even with their
[own
problems](https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/08/why-safe-notes-are-not-safe-for-entrepreneurs/). The
idea is to defer a more firm valuation until a later date.

With every new investment, founders dilute. As do any other shareholders:
common stock holders (anyone receiving equity in lieu of compensation, founders
included), and previous investors. This means that if you are 100% owner, or if
you have a 50/50 split (etc) between founders, then your share in the total
ownership will decrease as you add each investor. All of this is tracked in a
document called the capitalization table ("cap table" for "who put in what"
starting with founder share).

Put another way, you own a smaller piece of a larger pie. That is the whole
point in raising capital instead of bootstrapping your business based on
revenue. You need the capital to get the revenue (or else it is not advisable
to raise [as much] capital).

Noting that I'm speaking to a M.D. & Co who is for the first time considering a
startup... **Once you get past the complete overwhelm of all of this, continue
reading when you have the moment of:**

> **Ah, so that's the "capital" in capitalism!**
> **All these years, "capital" hiding in plain sight.**

At every round of funding (commonly: seed [sometimes called "angel"], A, B, C,
...), there is a balancing act in raising the right amount of capital. You want
to balance valuation with runway. The CEO has a responsibility to shareholders
to maximize the value of existing shares. In a few words, take a good deal (and
make revenue a top priority). But with an acceptable level of risk. If you do
not raise enough money (the runway), then the company could go out of business
or be in a vulnerable position for future investment, leading to a down round
in which shares are purchased a value lower than the previous round.

The seed round is often called the angel round, because the amounts (10s or
100s of thousands) are more appropriate to individuals of high net worth than
to institutional firms ("VCs").

If you would like to raise money from friends and family, you can certainly do
so. Tell them they will lose their money and see if they still want to do
it. Turns out, they will. Their goal is to support you, not a return on
investment. Note that the [SEC has an opinion about who can
invest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp).

Back to professional investors, they generally seek preferred stock. These come
with specific terms, but in short: they get paid before you do should the
company ever change hands or dissolve.

A few words about institutional investors, noting that I am speaking from the
founder's perspective and not the investor's:

* Investors are generally interested in financial projections which have
  oversized returns, meaning that the projection has exponential growth
  (whereas small businesses or long-running companies will focus on year over
  year growth, which is approximately linear or logarithmic). Imagine a slide
  deck with a hockey stick in it. Even if it is made up, many investors want to
  see that you will go after it regardless.
* Very often a startup has more than one investor in a round. The first
  investor to commit will shape the terms for other investors.
* Raising money often means talking to 10 prospective investors for every 1
  investor.
* Several VCs will say, "Sounds great! Come back when you need [some number in
  the millions]."
* They may also say something which indicates to you, "Oh, and come to us
  before talking with other investors." Then, you really know that they are
  interested, because they think they have a headstart to you on knowing the
  value of your company.

One final note on raising capital. In doing so, you are instantly a
millionaire. Of course, not really. You hold stock in a company for which there
is no stock market. But your relationship to money and to risk will be
tested. Especially when you are taking real dollars from people who know
precisely their relationship to money and to risk.


## #2: Keep the cap table clean.

For context, consider the "serial entrepreneur":

1. Sets out to offer a product or service.
2. Along the way, learns everything about running a business. The hard way.
3. What to do with these new skills? Well, let's start another one!

Alternatively, being the first-time entrepreneur or first-time _anything_ means
that there is no way that you have all of the skills.

You are going to want to get people involved. You are going to value their
input. You are going to want to compensate them for that. You are going to want
to give them equity instead of cash since (a) you do not have much cash but you
have a lot of equity and (b) you want them to have an incentive in your
success.

Be slow in giving out equity. Building a successful business is a long game. A
contribution will feel like a lot today, but could be a small blip in the long
run.

It's not selfish to keep equity to yourself. It's what's best for the
company. You run a company now.

Keeping the cap table clean means that only founders and critical people have
equity before raising money, and when you raise money, you do so in substantial
rounds (much like closing on a mortgage).

Besides, people do not expect compensation when helping out. Not at first,
anyway.


## #3: Vest.

When you give people equity in the form of common stock, have it vest over time
instead of having them hold the equity immediately. This is true for
cofounders, no matter how well you trust them (though exceptions are
appropriate when you already share finances in a life partnership).


## #4: Make a projection on market fit.

I always start here.

* Imagine your product or service.
* Imagine your market.
* Guess the size of the market. How many customers in total might exist?
* Make up a price.
* If you get 10% of the market at the price, do you have a business?

Even if these are wild guesses, and even if 10% is unrealistic, if you can look
at these numbers on the back of your cocktail napkin envelope and get excited,
then you are on to something. People spend weeks, months, and even years before
doing this on a business model which would fail this simple test.


## #5: A perspective on medical startups.

For medical startups, namely those with a consumer audience, I have found that
it is very important to focus on a clinically valid approach before being
concerned with commercialization. Get some preliminary data _at least_ if not a
full trial.

This makes fundraising particularly complicated in the early stage. That said,
health systems often invest in addition to being a customer. Selling to a
hospital takes 18 months +/-, but sophisticated management on a long-enough
timescale will recognize that the organization internally has too much
hierarchy and is too risk-averse to innovate. They _need_ to look externally to
innovate.

But Silicon Valley, and I do mean the region not the _HBO_ show, brings
"disruption" without even a clue that _clinically valid_ is a thing. The
quality improvement loop (dissemination & implementation of the latest evidence
into the care setting) may be severely challenged in US healthcare, but its
nonexistent to the "app developer."


## #6: A series of unfortunate events.

If you have a medical startup and you are raising capital, know the word
"[theranos](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/05/644844174/theranos-blood-testing-company-accused-of-massive-fraud-says-it-will-dissolve)"
before anyone else mentions it.


## #7: Roller Coasters

A startup is an emotional roller coaster until you are convinced that the
company/product/service that you are building is valid. Who knows when that
will happen. So, take the validation that you can and find your support
network.

Once off the emotional roller coaster, you are on the stress roller
coaster. "What's the problem today?"


## #8: You will meet people with big egos.

... and they will be so charismatic they will naturally feign a sense of
humility.

There is an abundance of people who have made a career out of all things
business. You will think they have some credential that you do not. You will
eventually conclude that it is all hollow, so let's save you some time and just
assume that it probably is (because it probably is).

Cynical, yes. The slightly less cynical justification: in every profession, the
best and brightest in the field will tell you that anywhere from 10-30% of
people in the field actually know what they are doing. Business is no
exception.

Regarding investors, there's smart money and dumb. Investors get good at asking
questions and getting to crux of the problem. Sometimes that problem is
actually your problem.

Above all, make it a point to know your business better than anyone. And do not
be afraid to ask questions or share your ideas.


## Closing

There's always more to say. I'll stop here.
